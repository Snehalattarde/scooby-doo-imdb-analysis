Project Overview

This problem set analyzes IMDb ratings of Scooby-Doo episodes to understand how ratings vary across episode formats and television networks.
Problem 1: How have IMDb ratings changed over time?
Interpretation:
IMDb ratings show variability across years, with certain formats clustering at higher ratings.
Problem 2: Should all episode formats be analyzed together?
Interpretation:
Movies and crossover episodes differ from standard TV episodes and were excluded to ensure fair comparisons.
Problem 3: Do IMDb ratings differ by network?
Interpretation:
ANOVA was used to test whether average IMDb ratings differ across networks. Post-hoc testing identified specific network differences.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
